# Code Refactor
### First Homework Assignment for UCONN Coding Boot Camp

This is the first homework assignment for my UCONN Coding Boot Camp.

The goal here is to refactor the original code base, cleaning it up and deploy it using GitHub Pages while remaining as close to the mock-up / screenshot as possible.

_The initial commit contains the original code base._

## Mock-Up
